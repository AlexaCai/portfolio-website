                <p style="text-align: justify">Chat app was created to allow people to talk and exchange on a mobile
                    app. Users can send messages like other very common chat apps (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.). They can
                    also send images, location and audios. Users can also customize their application by selecting the
                    color background they want to use for the chat UI.

                    chatting mobile application, as well as working with Firestore (a NoSQL cloud-based database service

                <h5 style="text-align: center">Tech summary</h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify">Chat app is built with React Native. The application Expo Go and Android
                    Studio have been used for the development. The chat interface have
                    been created using the Gifted Chat library. All chat messages are stored in a Google Firestore
                    Database and locally on users’ devices. Images and audios sent on Chat app are also stored in a
                    Google Cloud Storage created on Firebase, and the app authenticates users anonymously via
                    Firebase Authentication. The app also allows users to consult their messages offline by using
                    client-side storage (AsyncStorage pack. from React Native).

                <p style="text-align: justify">The original objective of this project was to build a serverless,
                    progressive web application (PWA) with React using Google OAuth / AWS Lambda for users
                    authentication and Google Calendar API to fetch different events, all of it under the Test Driven
                    development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) techniques, which align with the final
                    result.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">Being in my first steps with many topics covered in this project (OAuth,
                    serverless functions, AWS Lambda, TDD, BDD, PWA and visualization libraries), the most challenging
                    thing for me was to understand the working logic of all these new tools / concepts, especially
                    regarding authentication flow with Google OAuth and AWS Lambda. I add to do a lot of extra reading,
                    cross researches and real-life case study to better understand how it works.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify"><strong>While complex at first, I still enjoyed
                        learning more about OAuth process and serverless functions, as we can see those types of logic
                        being used in the real world by many other applications.</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify"><strong>I also enjoyed a lot learning about the
                        different testing techniques (TDD and BDD) since they put forward a specific and practical
                        development process that has many advantages, while ensuring that the codes written for an app
                        different features always work along the way, step by step (and therefore allows me to quickly
                        spot and correct any anomalies along the way as well).</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify"><strong>As for the PWA precisely, it was very
                        interesting to learn how an app can be converted to be installable on a desktop or a mobile
                        phone, as well as working offline. These two characteristics can greatly enhance
                        user-experience, making PWAs very interesting in web development.</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify"><strong>Finally, regarding the visualization tools
                        I’ve used at the end of this project, they are only a fraction of what is possible to represent
                        visually with Recharts. The use of visuals from this library in this project therefore allowed
                        me to understand quite well the functioning Recharts and opened the door to the possible use
                        (for other projects for example) of other different forms of visual representations that could
                        be extremely useful in many different contexts.

                    technology used for Meet app), which still allows me, despite all the new tools, technologies and
                    topics emerging from this project, to navigate into the development process with a good and solid
                    understanding of some of its key features.

                    to acquire a good understanding of the many new things encountered along the way both in theory and

                <p style="text-align: justify">In the end, my hope with this web app was that any user using it has a
                    simple, pleasant and easy-to-use experience to help them in their quest to find the next coding
                    event they would like to attend, whether the event being on React, jQuery, or Node.js, and whether
                    the event being in Dubai, Toronto or Tokyo.</p>
