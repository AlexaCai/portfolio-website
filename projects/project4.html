        <h1>Project description</h1>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
            The objective of that project was to build a serverless, offline working and progressive web application
            (PWA) with React using test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD) techniques. The
            web app also needed to use Google Calendar API to fetch different upcoming events in different
            cities for users benefit.
        </p>
        <h3>The web app</h3>
        <p>
            Meet app was created to serve as a platform to locate different events around the world. Users can use Meet
            app to have access to different information about different events. They can search for events based on
            targeted cities, or for all cities. They can also specify how many events they want to see displayed on
            their screen. This information is presented visually with dynamic scatter and pie charts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Scatter chart displays how many events take place in each city
            </li>
            <li>
                Pie chart displays the popularity of event genres
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Events information is also presented textually below the visuals. If users want to have more information
            about a specific event, they can expand that event to reveal more details, and then collapse it to the
            original presentation mode when finished. For each event, a hyperlink allowing users to switch from the web app
            to Google Calendar is given as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            All views are responsive to display well on any device. The web app is hosted online to make it
            shareable. However, users can also install Meet app as a web app on their computer desktop or their mobile
            phone screen for quicker access. The web app can also be used when the user is offline.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical information</h3>
        <p>Meet app is built using React. The different React components for the web app have been created following
            industry standards for project folders and files structure. The web app also uses the Google Calendar API to
            display events on users UI and utilize OAuth2 authentication flow to allow users accessing the web app. Meet app
            also uses serverless functions (AWS lambda) for the authorization server.</p>
